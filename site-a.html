<h3 id="bc">Business Case</h3>

<p><em>Extracted from site review report</em></p>

<p>
This site is a similar distance from the City Centre as the application site (Site F).
Journey time data from the Strat-E-GIS data-base has been used to establish the likely
‘round trip’ bus journey time in the weekday peak hours for both the ‘application’
site and the other option sites. Within the City Centre; an assumed turn-around point
in Orange Grove has been assumed, with routes to/from Cleveland Place considered
via Bathwick Street/Henrietta Road/Pulteney Bridge or The Paragon/Milsom Street
IN and Broad Street/The Paragon OUT.
</p>
<p>
The data indicates that the ‘round trip’ time for buses operating from the ‘application’
site in the 8:00-9:00am period would be circa 21 or 23 minutes for the two routes; and
22 or 27 minutes in the 5:00-6:00pm period. This would dictate a need for three buses
dedicated to operating the Park and Ride service based on a 10 minute frequency.
This ongoing operating cost; together with others, would have had to be balanced 
against the expected revenue in establishing the business case for the ‘application’
site.
</p>
<p>
The expected ‘round trip’ bus journey time from Site A will be similar; and hence the
number of buses needed to operate the same level of Park and Ride frequency in the
weekday peak hours.
</p>
<p>
From the revenue perspective Site A would be big enough to cater for 1400 spaces.
Although included in the site area for assessment it is not considered that the land
west of the A4/A46 interchange should be used. This land slopes steeply towards the
river and the potential vehicular access route under the bridge. As such, it would be
difficult to develop as an area for additional vehicle parking.

<h3 id="general-description">General Description</h3>

<p>The extent of land is largely to the east
and adjacent to the A4/A46 interchange. Most of the land is in the ownership of Avon
Rugby Club; the exceptions being a small area of rough pasture adjacent to the A46
embankment on the east side and the land west of the A46. The latter can be accessed
via a shared footpath/cycle linkage under the A46 main-line carriageway and sliproad
bridges spanning the River Avon. However, there is no current provision for
vehicular access under the bridge.</p>
<p>The level land most suitable for parking is associated with the rugby playing fields
and the adjacent tarmac strip currently used for this purpose. However, during the
site visit a person associated with Avon RFC advised that the sloping land between
the existing area used for parking and the rear boundary of the properties fronting
London Road had been used for parking in the past. As such, some of this land could
be utilised for Park and Ride parking spaces; although a landscaped buffer is likely to
be needed to reduce the impact on the adjacent residential properties.</p>

<h3 id="access">Highway Access</h3>

<p>
The existing access to Avon RFC is via a steep narrow roadway running down the
line of the slope as shown in Photo 2.1 below. The major-minor ‘priority’ junction
with London Road West has poor visibility to the left due to the adjoining residential
property. This view to the left is further obstructed by on-street parking which occurs
in front of the residential dwellings fronting this section of London Road West.
However, driver visibility to the right is satisfactory. 
</p>

<p>
Apart from the sub-standard visibility to the left the level area in the vicinity of the
junction bell-mouth only extends 5-6m back from the kerb-line; after which the steep
up-grade section of the access road is reached. Whilst this provides a sufficient level
waiting area for a car; it would not for an emerging bus. As such, bus drivers could
experience difficulty in emerging from the junction due to the ‘gap’ time in priority
traffic needed to exit safely. During the site visit we were also told by Avon RFC that
coaches have difficulty in negotiating the steep up-grade when leaving the site now.
</p>
<p>
In view of the above it is clear that the access road into the site would need to be realigned
to reduce the existing gradient. In addition, the junction would need to be 
improved. The only feasible means of improving the access road would be to re-align
it eastwards ‘across the slope’ using the wooded parcel of land behind the clubhouse
and changing rooms. This would require significant earthworks to ensure a
satisfactory gradient along the length of the access road; which would eventually
reach level ground near the NE corner of the land area considered.
</p>
<p>
Consideration could be given to using either signal or major-minor ‘priority’ control
for the access junction with London Road West. The former is considered preferable
as a bus priority loop could be included in the detection to assist emerging buses.
Furthermore, the required 90m visibility to the left required for a 30mph road may be
difficult to achieve with a priority junction layout. The width of London Road West in
the vicinity of the junction is sufficient to provide a separate right turn lane for
vehicles accessing the site from the west. However, some of the on-street parking
which occurs on the south side of London Road immediately west of the access
would need to be prohibited to enable this.
</p>
<p>
 It is probable that users seeking to access this site from the A363 Bradford Road and
A4 Box Road in the morning peak period will choose to route via Batheaston; rather
than use the bypass and turn right at the A4/A46 interchange. This is because
queuing and delay occurs on the northbound exit slip-road in this period; which is
exacerbated by westbound exit blocking associated with queuing on the A4 London
Road. Whilst this queuing also extends into London Road West it is likely that drivers
accessing the site from the A4 and A363 will experience less delay by routing via
Batheaston. As such, locating the Park and Ride site will have a potential adverse
impact in encouraging westbound access traffic to use the more sensitive route via
the High Street. 
</p>

<h3 id="flooding">Flood Risk</h3>

<p>
Flood Zone maps provided by the Environment Agency show that most of this site
falls within Flood Zone 3. Following the heavy rain in
December 2012 the planning field area experienced river flooding. 
</p>

<p>
Technical Guidance to the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF); dated March
2012, covers the approach to be taken when considering development in areas of
known flood risk The section on Flood Risk largely mirrors the previous guidance
contained in Planning Policy Statement 25 ‘Development and Flood Risk’ (PPS25).
The flood zone levels are defined as follows:
<p>

<ul>
<li>Zone 1: Low Probability. Land assessed as having a less than 1 in 1000
annual probability of river or sea flooding in any year (<0.1%); </li>
<li>Zone 2: Medium Probability. Land assessed as having between a 1 in 100 and
1 in 1000 annual probability of river flooding (1% – 0.1%); and</li>
<li>Zone 3a: High Probability. Land assessed as having a 1 in 100 or greater
annual probability of river flooding (>1%); and</li>
<li>Zone 3b: Functional Floodplain. This zone comprises land where water has to
flow or be stored in times of flood. The Guidance states that the identification
of functional floodplain should take account of local circumstances and not
be defined solely on rigid probability parameters. However, land which
would flood with an annual probability of 1 in 20 (5%) or greater in any year,
or is designed to flood in an extreme (0.1%) flood would normally be
identified as functional floodplain.</li> 
</ul>

<p>
As stated above the Flood Zone maps show much of Site A in Flood Zone 3.
Although 3a and 3b is not separately defined it is considered that this is functional
floodplain which, if removed by protection works, would increase flooding extent
downstream. The Guidance is clear on what development is permissible in such a
high flood risk area; stating that:</p>

<blockquote>
<cite>
“Only the water-compatible uses and the essential
infrastructure listed in Table 2 that has to be there should be permitted in this zone. It should
be designed and constructed to:

– remain operational and safe for users in times of flood;
– result in no net loss of floodplain storage;
– not impede water flows; and
– not increase flood risk elsewhere.
Essential infrastructure in this zone should pass the Exception Test”. 
</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>
The exception test is
not considered applicable as a Park and Ride is not ‘essential’ development. It is
further noted that car parks are not listed as ‘water compatible development’ in the
NPPF Technical Guidance. Whilst it could be argued that occasional flooding of a
Park and Ride car park located on this site would not reduce storage or impede water
flow; this would render the site un-operable and could pose safety risks to users if
flooding occurred whilst the site was in use and parked vehicles present.
</p>

<p>
In paragraph 5 of the NPPF Technical Guidance it states in part that <blockquote><cite>“Only where there
are no reasonably available sites in Flood Zones 1 or 2 should decision-makers consider the
suitability of sites in Flood Zone 3, taking into account the flood risk vulnerability of land uses
and applying the Exception Test if required”.</cite></blockquote> As noted later in this review there are
feasible options available which have minimal or no impact on Flood Zone 3. 
</p>

<h3 id="landscape">Landscape</h3>

<p>
Site A is located within the following landscape, cultural and environmental
designations:
</p>

<ul>
<li>International designations: Bath World Heritage Site;</li>
<li>Local Plan designations: Green Belt; Conservation Area, Forest of Avon.</li> 
</ul>

<p>
The site is located on land known as Hicks Fields on the northern edge of the broad
and open River Avon valley floor and is operated by Avon Rugby Club for use as
rugby pitches and a clubhouse. The site is bounded by the River Avon to the south,
the A4 to the west, London Road and associated ribbon housing to the north and a
continuation of the open river valley to the east. A significant proportion of the site is
located within the level floodplain of the adjacent River Avon, with the remainder
located on the lower slope of the river valley’s northern side. The indicative site
boundary also includes a parcel of rising rough grassland to the west of the A4.
</p>
<p>
The southern half of the site comprises open, short-mown playing pitches which are
located on an artificially levelled, low lying area directly to the north of the River
Avon (at c. 21m AOD). The river edge supports riverine trees (willow and alder) and
there is an area of wet woodland located adjacent to the river just to the east of the A4
overbridge. The pitches are bounded by an access track to the north, which follows
the line of some degraded former field boundary hedges, beyond which is an area of
unmanaged rough grassland and scrub which currently forms a spatial buffer
between the housing located along the A4 and the pitches. The areas of the site either
side of the A4 comprise rough pasture and screen planting established during the
construction of the A4.
</p>
<p>
A public right of way runs through the site from east to west along an alignment
broadly parallel with the river. To the west of the A4, this takes the form of a
combined cycleway/footpath. To the east of and parallel to the A4, a spur off the
cycleway/footpath leads up to the A4/London Road roundabout.
</p>
<p>
The most likely access route to the site would descend from the current access road
junction with London Road, down through an area of broadleaf woodland and scrub
to the level floodplain where the park and ride facility would be located. 
In the wider context, the site is located within the Bathford and Limpley Stoke Valley
Landscape Character Area (LCA 18) as identified in the ‘Rural Landscapes of Bath
and North East Somerset – A Landscape Character Assessment’. This character area
comprises the broad, open valley of the River Avon, which generally comprises
grazing land on the flat or gently sloping valley floor with a relatively modern field
pattern with hedged boundaries. The valley also contains important transport 
corridors, features settlement on the valley sides and significant detractors in the
form of traffic and road infrastructure, pylons and some inappropriate development.
However, the valley is nonetheless valued for its encircling landscape of hills and
green valleys which provide a dramatic backdrop to the north-east part of the city
and make a significant contribution to the unique character of Bath, as reflected in its
status as a World Heritage Site. The current use of the site as recreational land
generally aligns with the character of the wider Bathford and Limpley Stoke Valley.
</p>
<p>
As reflected in the designations which apply to it, the landscape quality of the site is
considered High to Moderate (on an indicative scale of High, Moderate and Poor).
This is predominantly because the site is characteristic of the wider, semi-natural
valley landscape which contributes to the unique character of the city rather than the
localised value of its constituent parts. However, the site does support some
landscape features of local landscape value in the form of riverine trees and river
edge habitat, wet woodland, former field hedgerows and sycamore dominated
woodland. 
</p>

<h3 id="visual">Visual</h3>

<p>
The site is located in a generally open and low lying area on the valley floor, which
makes it visible from surrounding higher ground, most immediately from the north,
but also from the south and east. Some visual screening is provided by trees and
hedgerows on and adjacent to the site, and housing along London Road and the A4
tend to screen views from further north and west.
</p>

<p>
Potential visual receptors include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Approximately 13 properties with generally open and elevated views over
the site located directly adjacent to the northern boundary of the site along
London Road.</li>
<li>Intermediate distance views of 300m+, generally filtered and/or oblique, from
several other properties to the east along London Road and south from
within the valley floor.</li>
<li>Approximately 50 properties on higher ground in Bathampton with elevated
but frequently filtered views across the valley to the site of approximately
1km distance.</li>
<li>Users of the public right of way which passes through the site would
experience close views of the proposal, with more distant views afforded
from another public footpath located on the other side of the River Avon.
</li>
<li>Users of the A4 over a short distance where the road crosses the River Avon.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="agriculture">Agriculture & Land Use</h3>

<p>
The site straddles the boundary between Grade 7 (urban) and Grade 4 land (where
Grades 1, 2 and 3a represent the best and most versatile grades of agricultural land).
Much of the site – all of the sports fields – falls within the Green Belt. 
</p>

<h3 id="biodiversity">Biodiversity</h3>

<p>
There are no sites of international or national importance within or close to the site.
The part of the site immediately adjoining the riverbank forms part of the River Avon
Site of Nature Conservation Interest (SNCI), and there is a Local Nature Reserve
(LNR) 570m to the west of the site (Kensington Meadows LNR). Both designations
are covered by BathNES Local Plan Policy NE.9.
</p>

<h3 id="infrastructure">Community Infrastructure & Transport</h3>

<p>
The playing field part of the site is designated by BathNES Local Plan Policy SR.1A as
Protected Playing Fields / Recreational Open Space, the loss of which will not be
permitted unless four criteria can be met.
</p>
<p>
Two public footpaths cross the site. Footpath ref BA24/1 leaves London Road West
close to Lambridge House, traverses the site, passes underneath the A4 adjacent to
the river. A second public footpath (ref BA2/1) heads south-east from the A46
roundabout along the eastern edge of the dual carriageway embankment to meet
BA2/1 from where it heads north-east across the playing fields towards Bathampton
Bridge. 
</p>

<h3 id="heritage">Cultural Heritage & built environment</h3>

<p>
The site falls within the City of Bath World Heritage Site and Bath Conservation
Area. One listed building is within 50m (Merton Lodge, on the north side of London
Road West). A further seven listed building entries are within 250m of the site, four of
which are north of the site set back on the north side of London Road West. The
remaining three are west of the A4 dual carriageway (Lambridge House, the horse
trough on London Road close to its junction with Gloucester Road and the park
keepers’ cottages within Alice Park). 
</p>

<h3 id="pollution">Pollution Prevention</h3>

<p>
The site immediately abuts the eastern end of the Bath Air Quality Management
Area, which extends from the A36 roundabout into bath along the London Road. The
proposed park and ride would however be consistent with the Air Quality Action
plan, as action plan measures include the Bath transportation Package, which
includes park and ride.
</p>
<p>
The site falls wholly within the Bath Hot Springs Protection Area. 
</p>

<h3 id="business-case">Potential Business Case</h3>

<p>
This site is a similar distance from the City Centre as the application site (Site F).
Journey time data from the Strat-E-GIS data-base has been used to establish the likely
‘round trip’ bus journey time in the weekday peak hours for both the ‘application’
site and the other option sites. Within the City Centre; an assumed turn-around point
in Orange Grove has been assumed, with routes to/from Cleveland Place considered
via Bathwick Street/Henrietta Road/Pulteney Bridge or The Paragon/Milsom Street
IN and Broad Street/The Paragon OUT.
</p>
<p>
The data indicates that the ‘round trip’ time for buses operating from the ‘application’
site in the 8:00-9:00am period would be circa 21 or 23 minutes for the two routes; and
22 or 27 minutes in the 5:00-6:00pm period. This would dictate a need for three buses
dedicated to operating the Park and Ride service based on a 10 minute frequency.
This ongoing operating cost; together with others, would have had to be balanced 
against the expected revenue in establishing the business case for the ‘application’
site.
</p>
<p>
The expected ‘round trip’ bus journey time from Site A will be similar; and hence the
number of buses needed to operate the same level of Park and Ride frequency in the
weekday peak hours.
</p>
<p>
From the revenue perspective Site A would be big enough to cater for 1400 spaces.
Although included in the site area for assessment it is not considered that the land
west of the A4/A46 interchange should be used. This land slopes steeply towards the
river and the potential vehicular access route under the bridge. As such, it would be
difficult to develop as an area for additional vehicle parking.
