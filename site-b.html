<p>
The site is located adjacent to the A4 Bathampton
Bypass to the west of Mill Lane with access
via a new junction onto the A4 dual carriageway.
The design of this new junction will be
reviewed to see if it can be located west of Mill
Lane Bridge possibly using a slip road.

<h3 id="general-description">General Description</h3>

<p>
The extent of land considered as Site B; which is immediately west of
Mill Lane and bounded by the A4 Batheaston Bypass to the south. The northern
boundary is taken to be the existing access track to New Leaf Farm. During the visit
made to this site it was noted that the junction this access forms with Mill lane has
been moved southwards and improved and the eastern end of the track re-aligned.
The former access point onto Mill Lane at the entrance to Bathampton Manor has
been abandoned; although it is still shown on the Ordnance Survey plan.
</p>
<p>
The whole of the identified land is currently used for pasture. The section of the
bypass running along the southern boundary of the site is in cutting; with a
noticeable level difference between the road and the site, particularly at its eastern
end near the Mill Lane over-bridge. Since the bypass passes in cutting under the
bridge the relative height between the northern abutment/approach embankment on
Mill Lane and the site is not significant. At the access junction to New Leaf Farm all
level difference between the site and Mill Lane is obviously removed by this point.
</p>
<p>
High voltage electricity lines run east-west across Site B; as in fact they do on the
existing application site (Site F). There is a large pylon situated fairly centrally within
the site. National Grid Regulations controlling the safety clearances required to this
structure and the lines would have to be observed to prevent ‘flashover’ accidents
from occurring. This may affect where roadways and parking bays can be positioned;
and the location of lighting columns and any site trees or high level screening
vegetation. 
</p>

<h3 id="access">Highway Access</h3>

<p>
The position of an access junction to this site with the A4 Batheaston Bypass is
dictated by the proximity of the eastbound slip-road merge zone at the A4/A46
junction. This merge; which is a ‘lane gain’ type, is situated just east of New Leaf
Farm at the assumed western edge of the site. The permissible spacing between a
merge and a downstream junction is set out in the Design Manual for Roads and
Bridges (DMRB) under TD22/06 ‘Layout of Grade Separated Junctions’. For ‘weaving
length’ there is a mandatory requirement in paragraph 4.38 which states <blockquote><cite>“For AllPurpose
Roads, the minimum length between a grade-separated junction designed to this
standard and at at-grade junction (including roundabouts), service area, lay-by or direct
access must be the desirable minimum weaving length as defined in paragraph 4.36 for rural
roads (1000m) or the minimum length of weaving section as defined from paragraph 4.37 for
urban roads”</cite></blockquote>. Using definitions in TD22/06 the Batheaston Bypass could be described
as an Urban All-Purpose Road (UAP) by virtue of the 50mph speed limit in force on
the dual carriageway; although it is rural in nature. 
</p>
<p>
Using the UAP category for the bypass the minimum desirable weaving length is
determined from the estimated weaving flows and the design speed in km/hour. The
maximum hourly eastbound flow on the bypass obtained from the Highways Agency
TRADS database for April and May 2012 is 994vph between 8:00-9:00am and 1254vph
between 5:00-6:00pm (Mon-Thurs). Of this the only drivers required to change lane
would be those attempting to access the Park and Ride site from the eastbound mainline
(A46). This volume is unlikely to be high so the weaving length required will be 
dictated solely by the design speed. For a road with a 50mph speed limit the design
speed is circa 85-90kph. Using Figure 4/14 in TD22/06 the Absolute Minimum
Weaving Length needed would be 250-275m. This would dictate a junction position
close to the eastern end of the existing westbound lay-by. In order to maintain the
latter on the westbound exit side of the junction; the new access would need to be
situated quite close to Mill Lane bridge. However, this would make it impractical to
provide a sufficient length of right turning lane on the westbound approach to the
junction; as there is insufficient width to accommodate this widening through the
structure. Accommodating an access junction with the bypass to the west of Mill Lane
is thus likely to require a ‘Departure’ from standard with respect to TD22/06; which
would need to be agreed with the Highways Agency as the bypass form part of the
Strategic Road Network (SRN). A further issue with a junction just west of the bridge
is that the level difference between the road and the site is quite significant at this
point. As such, the volume of earthworks and ‘cut’ into the site to accommodate the
access road would be quite significant. 
</p>
<p>
In consequence, the junction location previously proposed to access the ‘application’
site (Site F) may also be needed to achieve suitable access to Site B. However, in this
case a loop road connection would be needed passing under Mill Lane. Whilst an atgrade
connection to Mill Lane just south of the access to New Leaf Farm would be
easier and cheaper to provide; this would undoubtedly encourage further rat-running
through Bathampton by drivers seeking a route between the A36 and A4 avoiding
Cleveland Place. As stated earlier, the embankment height on the northern Mill Lane
approach to the bridge over the bypass is relatively low. As such, a relatively deep
cutting will be needed to take the access road under Mill Lane, as well as a new
bridge to carry the existing road. The optimal position for the Mill Lane ‘cross-under’
would require further investigation, although an alignment south of the existing
pylon just east of Mill Lane is considered preferable to avoid undue impact on land
this side. The embankment here is also higher, so less excavation would be needed to
achieve the linkage under Mill Lane. 
</p>

<h3 id="flooding">Flood Risk</h3>

<p>
Flood Zone mapping provided by the Environment Agency show that this site is
largely unaffected by flooding. To the west of Bathampton Manor the access track to
New Leaf Farm falls within Flood Zone 2; but any parking spaces could be sited
away from this higher risk area. To the north of this track and west of the Manor the
land falls into Flood Zone 3. However, none of this land is considered as part of Site
B. 
</p>

<h3 id="landscape">Landscape</h3>

<p>
Site B is located within the following landscape and environmental designations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Local Plan designations: Green Belt; Forest of Avon.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The site is located on improved agricultural pasture land on the southern side of the
River Avon valley floor, directly to the south of Bathampton Manor. The site is
bounded by the A4 to the south, a continuation of agricultural grazing land to the
west and north-west, the grounds of a horticultural field station and Bathampton
Manor to the north, and Mill Lane and further grazing land to the east. The site is on 
gently rising land at around 28m AOD. The field boundaries comprise hedges on all
sides except for the northern perimeter, which comprises an access track leading to
some former farm buildings formerly associated with Meadow Farm. 
</p>

<p>
A public footpath runs across part of the site from the access track to the north to join
Mill Lane on the site’s eastern boundary. The Limestone Way, a long-distance right
of way, runs directly adjacent to the site along Mill Lane.
</p>
<p>
In the wider context, the site is located within the Bathford and Limpley Stoke Valley
Landscape Character Area (LCA 18), as described for Site A above. The current use
of the site as grazing land aligns with the historical character of the wider Bathford
and Limpley Stoke Valley.
</p>
<p>
As reflected in the designations which apply to it, the landscape quality of the site is
considered High to Moderate by virtue of the fact that it forms part of and is
characteristic of the wider, semi-natural valley landscape which contributes to the
unique character of the city rather than the localised value of its constituent parts.
However, it is not designated as part of the Cotswolds AONB nor the Bath WHS nor
does it support any significant landscape features of local value, with the exception of
two mature oak trees on the northern boundary and the boundary hedgerows. The
presence of two electricity pylons, one on the boundary and one in the centre of the
site, detracts from the intrinsic rural character of the site to a significant degree. 
</p>


<h3 id="visual">Visual</h3>

<p>
The site is located in a generally open and slightly elevated area within the valley,
which makes it widely visible from surrounding higher ground, particularly along
the line of the open valley to the east and west. In general however, visual receptors
with unobstructed views tend to be located some distance away from the site. The
following assessment relates only to the indicative site area to the east of Mill Lane
and does not include the access road and associated infrastructure which will be
required to link the site to the A4 and is likely to utilise an area west of Mill Lane .
Such access infrastructure is likely to increase the potential for adverse visual impact
on views from the east in particular, both during construction and operation. 
</p>

<p>
Potential visual receptors include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Substantially screened but close views from Bathampton Manor (a listed
building) and grounds over a distance of 20+m.</li>
<li>Generally open but partially oblique views from the converted former farm
buildings approximately 80m to the west of the western boundary of the site.</li>
<li>Approximately 20-30 properties to the north of and along London Road to
the north of the site, with elevated but often filtered views over a distance of
approximately 400m.</li>
<li>Approximately 150-200 properties to the west located on higher ground in
Lambridge, Fairfield Park and Larkhall, with long distance, often oblique and
partially filtered or screened views, over a distance of approximately 1.0 to
1.9km.</li>
<li>Approximately 100-150 properties to the east, located on higher ground in
Batheaston, with often oblique and partially filtered or screened views, over a
distance of approximately 0.9 to 1.4km.</li>
<li>Approximately 25-50 properties to the north-east, located on higher ground
off London Road, with often oblique and partially filtered or screened views,
over a distance of approximately 0.4 to 0.9km.</li>
<li>Approximately 20-40 properties to the south, located on higher ground to the
south of the A36 in Bathampton, with often oblique and partially filtered or
screened views, over a distance of approximately 0.7 to 0.9km.</li>
<li>Users of the public right of way which passes through the site and those
using the Limestone Way would experience close views of the proposal, with
more distant views potentially afforded from another public footpath located
on the other side of the River Avon.</li>
<li>Users of the A4 over a short distance where the road crosses the River Avon.
</li>
<li>Users of Mill Lane over a short distance where the road passes past the site.
</li>
<li>There are likely to be views of the site from locations within Bath, Batheaston
and Bathampton Conservation Areas.</li> 
</ul>


<h3 id="agriculture">Agriculture & Land Use</h3>

<p>
The site straddles the boundary between Grade 3 and Grade 4 agricultural land
(where Grades 1, 2 and 3a represent the best and most versatile grades of agricultural
land). The site is wholly within the Green Belt. 
</p>


<h3 id="biodiversity">Biodiversity</h3>

<p>
There are no sites of international or national importance within or close to the site.
The site is approximately 80m south of the River Avon SNCI, covered by BathNES
Local Plan Policy NE.9. 
</p>

<h3 id="infrastructure">Community Infrastructure & Transport</h3>

<p>
The site is not covered by any local plan designations protecting or reserving land for
community infrastructure. 
</p>

<p>
A public footpath (ref BA1/3) crosses the site in a broadly east-west alignment. It
leaves Mill Lane approximately 80m south of the entrance into Bathampton Manor
and crosses fields to pass underneath the A4 close to the River Avon. 
</p>

<h3 id="heritage">Cultural Heritage & built environment</h3>

<p>
The site does not fall within any heritage or built environment designations, but is
situated 100m south of the nearest part of the City of Bath World Heritage Site
(coterminous with the Bath Conservation Area) and 80m north of the Bathampton
Conservation Area.
</p>
<p>
Two Listed Buildings are within 100m of the site boundary; both are Grade II listed.
These are Bathampton Manor to the north and the railway bridge over Mill Lane to
the south. The cluster of Listed Buildings around Bathampton church are within
250m, which includes the Grade II* listed church. Other Grade II listed structures
within 250m includes four buildings along Bathampton Lane / High Street to the
south, Meadow Farm to the west (separated from the site by the A4 dual
carriageway), the former Bathampton Flour Mill (now pub) to the north and
Bathampton toll bridge itself. 
</p>

<h3 id="pollution">Pollution Prevention</h3>

<p>
The site falls wholly within the Bath Hot Springs Protection Area. No other
designations apply. 
</p>

<h3 id="business-case">Potential Business Case</h3>

<p>
This site is capable of accommodating 1400 spaces and; as with the adjacent
‘application’ site, would require three buses to operate a Park and Ride service with a
10 minute frequency in the weekday peak hours.
