            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
            Bath is embarking on the next stage of its development legacy with the
            recent adoption of the Bath Riverside Masterplan. Key to its success
            will be effective connectivity and access. The existing Park and Ride
            sites are very popular with the public and have recently been expanded.
            But people from the east have limited choices about where to park and
            face long queues especially along London Road. We therefore have to
            address this gap in provision to ensure that Bath’s growth is sustainable
            by providing good accessibility; a key component being a new Park and
            Ride to the East.
            </p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/services/parking-and-travel/transport-plans-and-policies/bath-transport-package">Getting Around Bath Transport Strategy</a>
            states that: <blockquote><cite>A park and ride site to the east would
            complete the picture, allowing people to choose
            not to drive into the centre and thus contribute to
            a better city environment.</cite></blockquote>
            </p>

            <p>And recommends: That further work is required
            to establish the need for increased Park and
            Ride capacity as part of a wider parking strategy
            and to undertake a detailed assessment of sites
            to the East of the City. This consultation forms
            part of the assessment process.
            </p>

            <h3>The Benefits of Park and Ride</h3>
            Park and Ride provides motorists with an efficient
            public transport offer at the edge of the city which
            reduces traffic in the historic central area. In doing
            so, the poor air quality from vehicle emissions can
            be reduced. The Park and Ride buses would use
            the existing bus lane on London Road to ensure
            the reliability of Park and Ride services and make
            Park and Ride use attractive when compared
            with completing journeys by car.

            <h3>Objectives for a Park and Ride Scheme</h3>
            <ul>            
            <li>To reduce congestion within the city and
            around our off-street car parking sites</li>
            <li>To improve the city’s environment</li>
            <li>To reduce car use into the city centre and improve
            the proportion of journeys made by public
            transport</li>
            <li>To reduce carbon emissions from transport</li>
            <li>To support the city’s economic development
            and Enterprise Area</li>
            <li>To improve connectivity to support business
            and growth of the wider region</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Identifying an appropriate site</h3>
            Park and Ride facilities need to be:
            <ul>
            <li>Well located for main roads to capture car
            drivers entering the City from the East.</li>
            <li>Near to the city to reduce travel time from the
            Park & Ride.</li>
            <li>Near to the city to reduce running costs.</li>
            <li>Large enough to support the expected demand.</li>
            </ul>            
            These considerations suggest that the <a href="/park-and-ride/sites">proposed sites</a> are viable sites for this facility.
